#### My friends keep on asking me "Why do you use _Vim_?". And my reply to this question is simple, to boost my **productivity**ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

By using Vim we force ourselves to use the keyboard every time we perform some action in our code. By not moving our hands from the keyboard to the mouse, we save a few seconds‚åõÔ∏è
These seconds are very minimal but when you see the amount of work you are able to do by just sticking to the keyboard, you will know why many people like using Vimüíª
If you are coding and you have to move your hand to the mouse, your productivity is affected. Whereas if you just use the keyboard and focus more on the code, you might enter the flow state which will help boost your productivityüë®‚Äçüíª
Now I don't use Vim directly and am more of a **_Vim extension_** user. I use Vim extensions/plugins in both VS Code and Goland(Golang ide by jetbrains).
In VS Code you can just search for "_Vim_" in the extension section and download it.

For Jetbrains IDEs you can download "_IdeaVim_" from the plugins section.

These extensions and plugins will help you to run your code in your code editor by using Vim commands. This will help you become more productive while keeping the features of your favourite IDEs.
Have a happy and productive programming!!üëã
