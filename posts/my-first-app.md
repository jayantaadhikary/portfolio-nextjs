I’ve always believed that mindfulness shouldn’t be a luxury—it’s a way of life. That’s why I built **The Stoic Monk**, a minimalist meditation app designed to help you cultivate inner peace, clarity, and purpose. In this blog post, I’ll share the story behind The Stoic Monk, how I tackled development using React Native and Expo 49, and the lessons I learned while balancing a full-time job, navigating health challenges, and shipping a major update.

## 🧘‍♂️ Why I Built The Stoic Monk

A year ago, I released the first version of The Stoic Monk as a side project with a very simple goal: to create a calm space amidst the chaos of everyday life. I was tired of the overly complicated and gamified meditation apps that filled the market. I wanted something straightforward—a tool that I could use daily to get centered, plan my goals, journal my thoughts, and reflect on Stoic wisdom.

**Core Features at Launch:**

- Meditation sessions with timer and ambient sound
- Personal journaling to capture thoughts and emotions
- Daily goal-setting to stay on track
- Inspiring Stoic quotes and readings

## ⚙️ Tech Stack: React Native + Expo 49

I chose **React Native** with **Expo 49** to get the job done quickly and maintain cross-platform compatibility.

But when Expo 53 introduced breaking changes in its router system, I hit a wall. Migrating required major refactoring I couldn’t prioritize at the time—so I stuck with Expo 49 to keep the project stable and shipping.

## 🚀 The First Launch & Lessons in Visibility

The initial version went live last year—but I didn’t market it.

It was more of a personal tool, and I wanted it to solve my own problems before worrying about traction. In hindsight, I wish I had shared the journey publicly to gather early feedback and build a community.

## 🔁 Fast-Forward to the Big Update

Despite holding a full-time job and going through a rough patch with my health, I pushed myself to ship a **massive update** last month.

### ✨ New Features

- **Ambient Sounds:** Multiple calming sound options during meditation
- **Multiple Timer Options:** More flexibility in meditation session duration
- **Revamped Pomodoro Timer:** Better UI and customizable work/break intervals
- **New Readings Section:** Explore the world of Stoic philosophy

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

- **Fixed Onboarding Glitch:** Auth state now handled properly
- **UI Overhaul:** Especially in the quotes section + a new, cleaner app icon
- **Heads up:** While the core experience is stable, there may be some minor screen layout issues (SafeAreaView bugs) on certain Android devices. I didn’t get to test thoroughly across all screen sizes—but it’s on my radar for the next patch!

This update wasn’t just about polishing features—it was about taking the app one step closer to becoming a true mindfulness companion.

## 🧠 What I’d Do Differently

1. **Start Marketing Early**  
   Sharing progress publicly builds accountability and feedback loops.

2. **Implement Analytics From Day One**  
   Know what features users love and where they drop off.

3. **Avoid Technical Debt When Possible**  
   Future-proofing your stack can prevent migration nightmares.

4. **Be Kind to Yourself**  
   Building while juggling work and health isn't easy. Pace matters more than speed.

## 📈 What’s Next

- **Premium Add-ons** (if demand increases)
- **iOS Support** (currently Android-only)
- **Smarter Recommendations & AI integration**
- **More Readings + Journaling Features**

## 🪷 Final Thoughts

Building The Stoic Monk has been both challenging and deeply fulfilling. It's taught me about mindfulness, not just in practice—but in the way we build, release, and reflect.

If you’re juggling a side project with work or health struggles—trust me, I get it. Just keep shipping. One small release at a time.
